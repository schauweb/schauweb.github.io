<h1>Process</h1>
<h2>Purpose, objective and goal</h2>
<p>By now it had been almost a year since I first tried to write our company's purpose, goals, and objectives.</p>
<p>At first I had a lot of trouble trying to figure out the difference between goals and objectives. The dictionary I looked in was not a lot of help, using each word in the definition of the other.</p>
<p>After agonizing over the definitions for a few months, I finally came to the conclusion that a goal was a desired result you could measure, while an objective was something desired that was easier to visualize or describe than to measure.</p>
<p>By this definition, reaching $100 million in sales or scoring a touchdown were goals, because they involved reaching a particular number or crossing a certain line.</p>
<p>Offering the best product or being honest in every business dealing became objectives, because there was no number or line involved.</p>
<p>Likewise, losing ten pounds would be a goal, but looking good in clothes would be an objective.</p>

<h2>Scrum</h2>
<p>It's a framework for delivery.</p>
<p>There are three roles: Scrum master, product owner, and development team.</p>
<p>Five events: sprint, sprint planning, daily scrum, sprint review, and sprint retrospective.</p>
<p>And three artifacts: product backlog, sprint backlog, and the increment.</p>
<p><br /></p>

<h2>Backlog</h2>
<p>Backlog of Broken Promises and Crushed Dreams.</p>
